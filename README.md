# Journey
Entering our college lives without much info about our surroundings made us curious and left us wanting to create a helpful platform. We deemed it necessary to help students; to share resources, to aid them financially and as a bonus, help us to achieve the same and also contributing towards the environment by promoting resource sharing.
